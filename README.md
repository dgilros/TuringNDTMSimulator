A simulator for multitape nondeterministic Turing Machines in Python 3.

Nondeterminism is simulated via a breadth first search (BFS) of the computation tree.

The directory tmsamples/ contains various examples of TMs: deterministic, nondeterministic, 1-tape, multitape, for trivial and nontrivial languages
